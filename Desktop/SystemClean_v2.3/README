With this script you can clean the system from unnecessary files.
Not affect the settings of either the system or any program!

SystemClean
-----------
System mean: 
- autoremove
- clean
- autoclean
- Clean unneeded files - Completely uninstall the programs were not fully removed | Clean all apt cache
- Clean all lists packages break down. *(You must have internet connection for this choice)*
- System_Logs - /var/log/ ~ Delete all system logs in directory /var/log/. Be sure that maybe you want these logs in the future, so deleting logs with your own risk.
- /tmp ~ Delete files from /tmp directory, where have user permission
- Memory Cache - Dangerous, use it with your own risk
- Old kernel packages

For old kernel packages you can remove any package you choose from the list.
Now, SystemClean supports for 50 old packages from kernels to remove.
If someone have more than 50 packages, then doesn't have choice in list to remove them
and must be remove them manually or with another app.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Please make sure that is better to have 'two' or more kernels installed in your system from 'one',
because if you destroy the kernel, to boot from one older kernel.


Home mean:
- Clean all programs cache you choose (Not affect the settings of program)
